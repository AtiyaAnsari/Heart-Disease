(3) Chest pain type: 0-absent, 1-Angina Pectoris, 2-Atypical Angina, 3-Non-Anginal Pain, 4-Silent Heart Attacks. 
(4) Resting blood pressure 
(5) Serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
(6) Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl 
(7) Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) 
(8) Maximum heart rate achieved 
(9) Exercise induced angina 
(10) oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
(11) The slope of the peak exercise ST segment: 0-Absent, 1-Upsloping, 2-Horizontal 
(12) Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
(13) Thal(Thalaessmia): 3 = Normal; 6 = Fixed defect; 7 = Reversable defect 
(14) Target: 0-No Heart Disease, 1-Heart Disease 
 
Conclusion:
Cardiovascular diseases is the most top disease which causes millions of deaths. We can take some steps to prevent this disease: The most obvious symptom is chest pain. There are three types of chest pain, but only atypical angina is strongly related to the heart disease.In addition, everyone should always keep an watch on the Resting blood pressure. The ideal resting blood pressure is lower than 120mmHg, but if your blood pressure is much lower than the 120mmHg, it means that you are under high risk of heart disease. Record your Maximum Heart Rate to make sure that your heart is still healthy. Don't forget the older we are, the higher the risks of Heart Disease. No matter how healthy we are, we must do annual examination of ourself because another feature that can not be taken care of by ourselves is age, as we have seen after 40 chances of getting heart disease increses.
